title: Reverse Linked List
sequence_number: 40
difficulty: easy
pattern:
  - linked-list
  - recursion
  - iteration

description: |
  Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

  For testing purposes, the linked list is represented as an array where `head[0]` is the head node.

constraints:
  - "The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000]."
  - "-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000"

examples:
  - input: "head = [1,2,3,4,5]"
    output: "[5,4,3,2,1]"
  - input: "head = [1,2]"
    output: "[2,1]"
  - input: "head = []"
    output: "[]"

  python:

      class Solution:
          def reverseList(self, head: List[int]) -> List[int]:
              pass
    reference_solution: |
      class Solution:
          def reverseList(self, head: List[int]) -> List[int]:
              return head[::-1]
    function_signature:
      name: reverseList
      params:
        - name: head
          type: "List[int]"
      return_type: "List[int]"

    expected: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
  - input: [[1, 2]]
    expected: [2, 1]

    expected: [1]
  - input: [[1, 2, 3]]
    expected: [3, 2, 1]
  - input: [[-1, -2, -3]]
    expected: [-3, -2, -1]
  - input: [[0]]
    expected: [0]
  - input: [[1, 1, 1, 1]]
    expected: [1, 1, 1, 1]

    expected: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  - input: [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]
    expected: [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
  - input: [[-5000, 5000]]
    expected: [5000, -5000]

  - input: [[1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3]]
    expected: [-3, 3, -2, 2, -1, 1]
  - input: [[0, 0, 0]]
    expected: [0, 0, 0]
  - input: [[7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42]]
