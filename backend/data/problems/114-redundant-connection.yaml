description: |
  In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

  You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

  Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of `n` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

constraints:
  - "n == edges.length"
  - "3 <= n <= 1000"
  - "edges[i].length == 2"
  - "1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length"
  - "ai != bi"
  - "There are no repeated edges."
  - "The given graph is connected."

examples:
  - input: "edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]"
    output: "[2,3]"
  - input: "edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]"
    output: "[1,4]"
