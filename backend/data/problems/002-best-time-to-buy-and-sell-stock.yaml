description: |
  You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

  You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

  Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

constraints:
  - "1 <= prices.length <= 10^5"
  - "0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4"

examples:
  - input: "prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]"
    output: "5"
    explanation: "Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5."
  - input: "prices = [7,6,4,3,1]"
    output: "0"
    explanation: "In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0."
