description: |
  You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

  Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:
  - `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
  - `i + j < n`

  Return the minimum number of jumps to reach `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

constraints:
  - "1 <= nums.length <= 10^4"
  - "0 <= nums[i] <= 1000"
  - "It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1]."

examples:
  - input: "nums = [2,3,1,1,4]"
    output: "2"
    explanation: "The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index."
  - input: "nums = [2,3,0,1,4]"
    output: "2"
