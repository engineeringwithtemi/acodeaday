description: |
  Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

  Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `ith` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.

constraints:
  - "1 <= hand.length <= 10^4"
  - "0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9"
  - "1 <= groupSize <= hand.length"

examples:
  - input: "hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3"
    output: "true"
    explanation: "Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]"
  - input: "hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4"
    output: "false"
    explanation: "Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4."
