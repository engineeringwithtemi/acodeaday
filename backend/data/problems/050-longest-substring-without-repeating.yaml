title: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
sequence_number: 50
difficulty: medium
pattern:
  - string
  - sliding-window
  - hash-table

description: |
  Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

constraints:
  - "0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4"
  - "s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces."

examples:
  - input: 's = "abcabcbb"'
    output: "3"
    explanation: "The answer is 'abc', with the length of 3."
  - input: 's = "bbbbb"'
    output: "1"
    explanation: "The answer is 'b', with the length of 1."
  - input: 's = "pwwkew"'
    output: "3"
    explanation: "The answer is 'wke', with the length of 3."
