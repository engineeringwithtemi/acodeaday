description: |
  Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

  A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:
  - Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
  - Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
  - Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

  Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

constraints:
  - "1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1"

examples:
  - input: "n = 19"
    output: "true"
    explanation: "1^2 + 9^2 = 82, 8^2 + 2^2 = 68, 6^2 + 8^2 = 100, 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1"
  - input: "n = 2"
    output: "false"
