description: |
  You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

  The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the **manhattan distance** between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

  Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.

constraints:
  - "1 <= points.length <= 1000"
  - "-10^6 <= xi, yi <= 10^6"
  - "All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct."

examples:
  - input: "points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]"
    output: "20"
    explanation: "We can connect the points as shown to get the minimum cost of 20."
  - input: "points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]"
    output: "18"
