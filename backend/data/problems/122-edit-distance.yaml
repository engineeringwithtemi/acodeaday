description: |
  Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

  You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
  - Insert a character
  - Delete a character
  - Replace a character

constraints:
  - "0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500"
  - "word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters."

examples:
  - input: 'word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"'
    output: "3"
    explanation: 'horse -> rorse (replace "h" with "r"), rorse -> rose (remove "r"), rose -> ros (remove "e")'
  - input: 'word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"'
    output: "5"
    explanation: 'intention -> inention (remove "t"), inention -> enention (replace "i" with "e"), enention -> exention (replace "n" with "x"), exention -> exection (replace "n" with "c"), exection -> execution (insert "u")'
