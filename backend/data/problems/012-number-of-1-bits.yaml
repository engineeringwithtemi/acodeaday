description: |
  Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of set bits it has (also known as the **Hamming weight**).

constraints:
  - "1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1"

examples:
  - input: "n = 11"
    output: "3"
    explanation: "The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits."
  - input: "n = 128"
    output: "1"
    explanation: "The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit."
  - input: "n = 2147483645"
    output: "30"
    explanation: "The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits."
