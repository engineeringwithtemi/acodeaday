  You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

  Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

constraints:
  - "1 <= nums.length <= 100"
  - "0 <= nums[i] <= 400"

examples:
  - input: "nums = [1,2,3,1]"
    output: "4"
    explanation: "Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4."
  - input: "nums = [2,7,9,3,1]"
    output: "12"
    explanation: "Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1). Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12."
