description: |
  Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

  A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

  For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

  A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

constraints:
  - "1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000"
  - "text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters."

examples:
  - input: 'text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"'
    output: "3"
    explanation: 'The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.'
  - input: 'text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"'
    output: "3"
    explanation: 'The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.'
  - input: 'text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"'
    output: "0"
    explanation: "There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0."
