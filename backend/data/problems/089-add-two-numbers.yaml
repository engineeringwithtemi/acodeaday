title: Add Two Numbers
sequence_number: 89
difficulty: medium
pattern:
  - linked-list
  - math

description: |
  You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

  You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

  The linked lists are represented as arrays of digits in reverse order.

constraints:
  - "The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100]."
  - "0 <= Node.val <= 9"
  - "It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros."

examples:
  - input: "l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]"
    output: "[7,0,8]"
    explanation: "342 + 465 = 807."
  - input: "l1 = [0], l2 = [0]"
    output: "[0]"
  - input: "l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]"
    output: "[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]"
