description: |
  Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

  The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2`).

  You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

constraints:
  - "1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4"
  - "-10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4"

examples:
  - input: "points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1"
    output: "[[-2,2]]"
    explanation: "The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10). The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8). Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin."
  - input: "points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2"
    output: "[[3,3],[-2,4]]"
