title: Container With Most Water
sequence_number: 10
difficulty: medium
pattern:
  - two-pointers
  - arrays
  - greedy
  - area-optimization

description: |
  You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

  Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

  Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

  **Notice** that you may not slant the container.

constraints:
  - "n == height.length"
  - "2 <= n <= 10^5"
  - "0 <= height[i] <= 10^4"

examples:
  - input: "height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]"
    output: "49"
    explanation: "The vertical lines are drawn at indices 1 and 8. The container has width 7 and height min(8,7) = 7, so area = 7 * 7 = 49."
  - input: "height = [1,1]"
    output: "1"
