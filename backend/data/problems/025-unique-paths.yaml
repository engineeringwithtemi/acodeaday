description: |
  There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

  Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

  The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10^9`.

constraints:
  - "1 <= m, n <= 100"

examples:
  - input: "m = 3, n = 7"
    output: "28"
  - input: "m = 3, n = 2"
    output: "3"
    explanation: "From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner: 1. Right -> Down -> Down. 2. Down -> Down -> Right. 3. Down -> Right -> Down."
