description: |
  Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

  A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

constraints:
  - "1 <= nums.length <= 2500"
  - "-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4"

examples:
  - input: "nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]"
    output: "4"
    explanation: "The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4."
  - input: "nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]"
    output: "4"
  - input: "nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]"
    output: "1"

              n = len(nums)
              dp = [1] * n

              for i in range(1, n):
                  for j in range(i):
                      if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                          dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

              return max(dp)
