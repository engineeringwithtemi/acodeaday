description: |
  Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

  There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return this repeated number.

  You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

constraints:
  - "1 <= n <= 10^5"
  - "nums.length == n + 1"
  - "1 <= nums[i] <= n"
  - "All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times."

examples:
  - input: "nums = [1,3,4,2,2]"
    output: "2"
  - input: "nums = [3,1,3,4,2]"
    output: "3"
  - input: "nums = [3,3,3,3,3]"
    output: "3"
