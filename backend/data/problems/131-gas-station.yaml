description: |
  There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

  You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

  Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**.

constraints:
  - "n == gas.length == cost.length"
  - "1 <= n <= 10^5"
  - "0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4"

examples:
  - input: "gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]"
    output: "3"
    explanation: "Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Tank = 4. Travel to station 4. Tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8. Travel to station 0. Tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7. Travel to station 1. Tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6. Travel to station 2. Tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5. Travel to station 3. Cost is 5. Gas is just enough to travel back to station 3."
  - input: "gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]"
    output: "-1"
