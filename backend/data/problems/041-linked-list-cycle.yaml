title: Linked List Cycle
sequence_number: 41
difficulty: easy
pattern:
  - linked-list
  - two-pointers
  - floyd-cycle

description: |
  Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

  There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.

  Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

  For testing purposes, the input is represented as `[values, pos]` where `values` is the list of node values and `pos` is the index of the node that the tail connects to (-1 if no cycle).

constraints:
  - "The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4]."
  - "-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5"
  - "pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list."

examples:
  - input: "head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1"
    output: "true"
    explanation: "There is a cycle, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed)."
  - input: "head = [1,2], pos = 0"
    output: "true"
    explanation: "There is a cycle, where the tail connects to the 0th node."
  - input: "head = [1], pos = -1"
    output: "false"
    explanation: "There is no cycle."
