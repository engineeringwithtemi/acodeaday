pattern:
  - bit-manipulation
  - array

description: |
  Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

  You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

constraints:
  - "1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4"
  - "-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4"
  - "Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once."

examples:
  - input: "nums = [2,2,1]"
    output: "1"
  - input: "nums = [4,1,2,1,2]"
    output: "4"
  - input: "nums = [1]"
    output: "1"
