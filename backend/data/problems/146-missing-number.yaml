  - array

description: |
  Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

constraints:
  - "n == nums.length"
  - "1 <= n <= 10^4"
  - "0 <= nums[i] <= n"
  - "All the numbers of nums are unique."

examples:
  - input: "nums = [3,0,1]"
    output: "2"
    explanation: "n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number."
  - input: "nums = [0,1]"
    output: "2"
    explanation: "n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number."
  - input: "nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]"
    output: "8"
    explanation: "n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number."
