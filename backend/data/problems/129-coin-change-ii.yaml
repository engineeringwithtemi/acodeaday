title: Coin Change II

description: |
  You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

  Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

  You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

  The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

constraints:
  - "1 <= coins.length <= 300"
  - "1 <= coins[i] <= 5000"
  - "All the values of coins are unique."
  - "0 <= amount <= 5000"

examples:
  - input: "amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]"
    output: "4"
    explanation: "There are four ways to make up the amount: 5=5, 5=2+2+1, 5=2+1+1+1, 5=1+1+1+1+1"
  - input: "amount = 3, coins = [2]"
    output: "0"
    explanation: "The amount of 3 cannot be made up by coins of 2."
  - input: "amount = 10, coins = [10]"
    output: "1"

                  for x in range(coin, amount + 1):
