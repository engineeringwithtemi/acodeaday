description: |
  Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

  - `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
  - `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

  Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

  Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return the minimum element of this array.

  You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

constraints:
  - "n == nums.length"
  - "1 <= n <= 5000"
  - "-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000"
  - "All the integers of nums are unique."
  - "nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times."

examples:
  - input: "nums = [3,4,5,1,2]"
    output: "1"
    explanation: "The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times."
  - input: "nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]"
    output: "0"
    explanation: "The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times."
  - input: "nums = [11,13,15,17]"
    output: "11"
    explanation: "The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times."
