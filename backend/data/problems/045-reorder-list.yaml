title: Reorder List
sequence_number: 45
difficulty: medium
pattern:
  - linked-list
  - two-pointers
  - stack

description: |
  You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

  `L0 → L1 → … → Ln-1 → Ln`

  Reorder the list to be on the following form:

  `L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …`

  You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

  For testing purposes, the linked list is represented as an array.

constraints:
  - "The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4]."
  - "1 <= Node.val <= 1000"

examples:
  - input: "head = [1,2,3,4]"
    output: "[1,4,2,3]"
  - input: "head = [1,2,3,4,5]"
    output: "[1,5,2,4,3]"

              result = []
              left, right = 0, len(head) - 1

              while left <= right:
                  if left == right:
                      result.append(head[left])
                  else:
                      result.append(head[left])
                      result.append(head[right])
                  left += 1
                  right -= 1
