description: |
  You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

  Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

constraints:
  - "1 <= n <= 45"

examples:
  - input: "n = 2"
    output: "2"
    explanation: "There are two ways to climb to the top. 1. 1 step + 1 step. 2. 2 steps."
  - input: "n = 3"
    output: "3"
    explanation: "There are three ways to climb to the top. 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step. 2. 1 step + 2 steps. 3. 2 steps + 1 step."
