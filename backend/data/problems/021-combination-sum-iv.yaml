description: |
  Given an array of **distinct** integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return the number of possible combinations that add up to `target`.

  The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a **32-bit** integer.

  **Note:** Different sequences are counted as different combinations.

constraints:
  - "1 <= nums.length <= 200"
  - "1 <= nums[i] <= 1000"
  - "All the elements of nums are unique."
  - "1 <= target <= 1000"

examples:
  - input: "nums = [1,2,3], target = 4"
    output: "7"
    explanation: "The possible combination ways are: (1,1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,3), (2,1,1), (2,2), (3,1). Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations."
  - input: "nums = [9], target = 3"
    output: "0"
