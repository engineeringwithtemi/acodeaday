# About

## The Project

acodeaday is an open-source daily coding practice platform that uses spaced repetition to help you master coding interview problems. Instead of cramming, you solve one new problem per day plus review problems at optimal intervals for long-term retention.

**Core Philosophy**: "A code a day keeps rejection away" - focused on understanding through consistent practice, not cramming.

## Why I Built This

Preparing for coding interviews can be overwhelming. Most people try to solve hundreds of problems in a short time, only to forget the patterns weeks later.

acodeaday takes a different approach:
- **Consistency over intensity** - One problem a day is sustainable
- **Spaced repetition** - Review at optimal intervals for retention
- **AI assistance** - Get unstuck without spoiling the solution
